There are kiddy programs, and definitely more to improve on...

1. Sch_Admin_Records.py - <A simple school admin program for enter/add student scores, add and remove students> written after completing online lessions for Python #3#. Yes it is 3 now and long gone the version used back in my school days...
2. CntMaxRepWordsf.py - <To count the max repeating words from *.txt file.*.> I initiated this program. Many trial codes used, and kept it there, to see the output at different stages of the processing the count.
3. hangman.py - <A Game master choosing a pre-defined word for Player 1 to guess>. Based on an institution enrolment coding test. Though didn't complete within an hour, took it is a challenge to myself and got it completed in 5 hours. 
4. readWriteFile.py - # This is Python for Data Science, Exercise 4-2, by Cognitiveclass.ai ... 


Basically... I need to find more exercises to sharpen my coding skills!

**Other Areas**

Found this learning path from CognitiveClass.ai, namely [**Applied Data Science with Python**](https://github.com/tkokhing/kiddyPython/tree/main/01%20Applied%20Data%20Science%20with%20Python). It covers the following (1) Data Analysis with Python, (2) Data Visualization with Python and (3) Python for Data Science. 

Sounds just right for me :)
