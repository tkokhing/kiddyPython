# kiddyPython
There are kiddy programs, and definitely more to improve on...

1. Sch_Admin_Records.py - <A simple school admin program for enter/add student scores, add and remove students> written after completing online lessions for Python #3#. Yes it is 3 now and long gone the version used back in my school days...
2. CntMaxRepWordsf.py - <To count the max repeating words from *.txt file.*.> I initiated this program. Many trial codes used, and kept it there, to see the output at different stages of the processing the count.
3. hangman.py - <A Game master choosing a pre-defined word for Player 1 to guess>. Based on an institution enrolment coding test. Though didn't complete within an hour, took it is a challenge to myself and got it completed in 5 hours.
